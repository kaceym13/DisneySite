<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website, Magical Disney World Tips!
I want to tell you about why I made this website.
My family and I go to Disney World at least once or twice a year. Throughout all my years being in Disney I have learned a lot of helpful tips that I want to share.
I have helped my friends and their parents with planning their trip because I know a lot about Disney. 
I wanted to share my information with everyone because I want people to have the best experience when they are on vacation. 
I hope my information on this page will help you with your next Disney World trip! </p>
