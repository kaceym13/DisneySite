<h1>Rides</h1>
<p>The rides are amazing! There is something there for anyone and everyone to do.
There are so many rides. The park with the most rides is Magic Kingdom.
My family and I go to Magic Kingdom on our first day so we can ride a lot of rides on our first day there.
Epcot and Animal Kingdom don't have many rides but there are still a lot of cool things to explore and do.
Hollywood is full of stuff to do also. They have added a lot of new rides recently, and they are amazing. 
The imagineers that come up with the rides and build them must enjoy it a lot! I would.

<p>This is what you can hear sometimes when you pass a ride. The scream of people on the rides.</p>
